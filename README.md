# stowey
A chrome extension that keeps track of wishlists without the hassle, built with React.

# Technologies
- React (TypeScript)
- Tailwind CSS

# Features
- Nested folder structure for easy organization
- Auto add current tab's link to item

# Why stowey?
I realized that most websites (like Amazon) have wishlist options but they're all limited to that website. I wanted something that didn't box me into a website's ecosystem and so I wanted to create the solution to my own problem. It's been a great opportunity for me to learn more about React and further hone my skills in Frontend Development.

# Where is stowey?
Currently, I'm still working on finishing the extension and will upload it to the chrome webstore when it is finished. Until then, you can clone the repository, build using npm run build, then upload the dist folder to your extensions settings.
